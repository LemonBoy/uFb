uFb 0.4
The Lemon Man (C) 2010-2011

A simple framebuffer-based console aiming for easyness and portability.
No format nor VT escape sequences are supported anymore from 0.4 as
were implemented horribly and werent really needed (printing an integer
is easy as writing 2-3 lines of code).

See supplied fonts to see how to use custom fonts.
Font size must be less or equal to 8 (both width and height), fonts
covering nonstandard (0-0xFF) ranges are supported too.

The 8x8 font in here is "msx" from PSPSDK.
The 6x8 font in here is "???" from a Nokia Manual.
